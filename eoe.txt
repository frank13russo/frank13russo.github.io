Throughout my career as a mechanical engineer, I have had the opportunity to experience all aspects of mechanical engineering.  I’ve completed mechanical designs and documentation of sheet metal, CNC machined, and additively manufactured parts.  I’ve designed and put together electronic and mechanical assemblies.  
In the realm of mechanical analysis, I have experience with Ansys Mechanical to create static structural finite element models and Computational Fluid Dynamics software to ensure adequate cooling of high power electronics equipment.
In my second job out of college, I taught myself how to program a CNC Machine with G-Code, and then with CAM software.  I’ve fabricated my own parts out of aluminum.  I’ve assembled and tuned RF Fixtures to ensure adequate RF measurements.  I like seeing my designs come to life in front of me just as much as I enjoy solving problems on the computer. 
I practice software engineering and programming in my free time, most recently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have had various roles throughout my career, including the detailed design engineer, the mechanical analyst, the mentor, the mentee, the project manager, the software developer and the system engineer.
Recently, I have had the pleasure of working in the lab with robots and the related automated systems that we use at Northrop Grumman to test RF Modules.  Supporting and maintaining these systems requires knowledge and experience of many different engineering disciplines.
There are many ways that one can demonstrate excellence in engineering.  For me, it is the breadth of knowledge that I find most rewarding.  For my entire career, learning new things has been one major constant across all of the projects I’ve worked on.
